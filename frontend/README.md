# Frontend for the vention pendulum app

## Overview
This is a bare-bones frontend, I chose to do it quite simple, as I could not
start the challenge until Monday, so in an effort to have something presentable
I have gone with straight Javascript running in Vite.

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) && npm installed 

To initialize the frontend server run the following commands:  
`npm install`   
`npm run dev`  

This will start a simple web server which by default will host the page at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
In order to interact with the frontend, it will require the backend api processes to be running
Please follow the instructions in the `api` directory to get them running.
